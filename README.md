# A little bit about Nina Hille Bringsdal
Hello! My name is Nina, and I am a biologist currently working on my master thesis in coastal ecology.

## My Career Passions
I would like to go into the fields of research on large terrestrial and/or marine mammals, study of their behavior, and work with and understand complex ecological modelling.
